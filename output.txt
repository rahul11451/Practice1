A Summary from ETS

 

‘The Graduate Record Examinations® (GRE*) Ceneral Test measures sls that facut and graduate deans have
consistently said are essential to graduate school sucess. These sls of verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning,
‘and cial thinking and analytical writing are foundational sil for applicants o a US. graduate program,
regardless of educational or inguisic background or county of oxgin.

‘Athough the GRE Progam has many studies ofthe predictive vay ofthe GRE General Test (which re avaiable
‘on the GRE website: wants. org/gre), a recent meta-and}ss by non-ETS researchers Nathan Kunce, Sarah
Hedett and Deniz Ones provides addtional postive evidence of the relationship ofthe GRE General Tes to vious
<itesa of graduate school success This meta-analysis important because predictive vay stdies ae often
<del to conduct or a variety of easons (eg. insufcient data test scores or predictors of success that do not
‘vary greatly across examinees). Compared with ear research, the Kunce et
‘ol metoanahsis improved on these studies by examining the vay
‘ofthe GRE General Test for mutiple dscptins using multiple
measutes of sucess, and by addressing statistical arfots
such as ange resto,

Inadton, the study looked at ve predictors of
success and eight ceria fr succes. The predictors
included the thee measures ofthe GRE Geneval Test

reasoning), GRE Subject Test scores and undergraduate

Results of the Kuncel et a. study
Rests rom this study show that:

1. The GRE General Testis “generalzably vaid predictor of fist-year graduate GPA, overall graduate GPA,
‘comprehensive exzm scores, publication ctaton counts and faculty ratings”

2, The GRE Genera Test ao conelates positively with degree atainment and research producty

3. The GRE Genera est has better preditve valty than undergraduate grades o letters of recommendation.

4, The GRE Subject Tests are better predictors of success than either the GRE Gener Test or undergraduate GPA.

‘This metoanahssstdy is important because these results apply across a ange of intended academic majors
acs nave speakers of English and nonnative speakers of English, acoss tational and nontraditional students
‘and across masters and doctoral programs?

Validity of the Analytical Writing Measure

‘Because the Kuncel et ol met»anahsis was conducted before the Anaycal Weng (RN) measure was.
Insoduced into the GRE General Testi may be useful to indude vay information fortis measure. The 1wo
tasks that comprise the AW are both considered essential in many felds of gradute study, These two tasks ae
‘complementary in thatthe ist equies the wir to constuc his/her own argument about an issue, and the
second requies a citque of someone else's argument by assessing its chims. For vitually al ciscpine, AW adds
valve to the GRE Genera! Test because it provides unique informaton about tsttaker ables over and above
skills measured in the Verbal and Quantitative measures.

‘Demonstrating the construct validity of the writing measure can be done by showing how AW correlates with other
‘measures ts intended to resemble. As anllstation, AN corelates postvey wth other samples of academic
iting produced by examinees? as shown inthe figure Below. Exaineesin this study were asked to provide two
ting samples: one presenting their typical writen work and one not quite as well written.

‘Summary

Because facuty want to make the best posible admissions decisions about graduate schoo! applicants, itis
lmpocant to look cbectvely atthe predicive value of the GRE General Test. The Kuncl eto study used all
‘existing data to arive atthe suds conclusions thatthe GRE General Tests a valid predictor of many crea of
sraduate school success. n ation, other research has demonstrated thatthe Analyical Weng ection ofthe GRE
(General Test can provide valuable information about applicant’ abies to produce analytical essays. For these
‘reasons, the GRE General Tests a valuable asset inthe graduate admission process.
