A Comprehensive Review

‘A Summary from ETS

 

The Graduate Record Examinations* (GRE*) General Test measures sls that facity ad graduate deans have
‘consistent said ae essential to graduate school success. These skis of verbal reasoning, quantitate reasoning,
‘and cial thinking and analytical wating are foundational sks for applicant to a US. graduate program,
regardless of educational or inguisc background or county of origin.

‘Athough the GRE Program has many studies ofthe presi vali ofthe GRE General Test which re avble
‘on the GRE website: wametsorg/are), 2 recent meta-analysis by nor-ETS researchers Nathan Kuncl Sereh
Healt and Derie Ones provides addtional poste evidence of the relationship ofthe GRE General est to various
‘ite of graduate schol succes. This metaana}sisiimpotant because predicive vaidiy studies are often
dict to conduc fora varity of reasons (eg insfcient deta test scores ot predictors of success that donot
vary greatly azoss examinees), Compared wit eae research, the Kuncel et

In addon, the study looked a five predictors of

included the three measures of the GRE General Test
(Gerba reasoning, quantitate reasoning and analytical

Results of the Kuncel et al. study

Results from this study show that:

1. The GRE Genera Testis a “genessizably valid predicr of fst.year graduate GPA, overal graduate GPA,
‘comprehensive exam scores, pubscaion citation counts and faculty ratings”

2, The GRE General Test also conelates pestvely with degree atainment and research productivity

'3, The GRE General Test has better predicive vay than undergraduate grades or letters of recommendation.

4, The GRE Subject Tess are better prdicios of sucess than either the GRE Genera Testor undergraduate GPA.

This meta-analysis study i important because these resuts apply acoss a range of intended academic majo
‘across native speakers of English and nonnative speaker of English, across tational and nonvaditional students
and across maste’s and doctoral programs?”

Validity of the Analytical Writing Measure

Because the Kuncl et ol metaanajss wos conducted before the Anica Wing (AW) measure was
invoduced io the GRE General Test, my be usell'o include vide information fr this measute. The Wo

complementary in hat the fst equies the waiter to const he/her oun argument about an issue, and the

Demonstrating the construct vay ofthe writing measure can be done by showing how AW comelates with other
‘measures tis intended to resemble. As an isttaton, AW correlates postvely wth ther samples of academic

Summary

Because facty went to make the best possible admissions decisions about graduate school applicants itis
Jmporant to look cbectively atthe predictive value ofthe GRE Genevol Test. The Kuncel eto. study used al
‘existing dat to ave at the studs conclusions thatthe GRE General Tests a valid pedir of many citeta of
‘graduate school success. In addon, other research has demonstrated that the Analytical Witing section ofthe GRE
‘General Test can provide valuable information about appicans’' ables to produce analytical essays. For these
1easons the GRE General Testa valuable asset inthe graduate admissions process.
